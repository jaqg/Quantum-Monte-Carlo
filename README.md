## Installation

To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaqg/Quantum-Monte-Carlo.git
cd Quantum-Monte-Carlo
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to create a virtual environment to install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the provided scripts to simulate quantum systems using Monte Carlo algorithms. For example:

```bash
python particle_simulation.py
```

This will run a simulation of a particle system using the Monte Carlo method.
